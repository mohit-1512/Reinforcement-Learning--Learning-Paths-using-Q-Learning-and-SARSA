# Reinforcement Learning- Learning Paths using Q-Learning and SARSA

Language Used- Java Swing
-----------------
Problem Statement:
-----------------
In this project we used reinforcement to learn and adapt “promising paths” in robot-style grid world. 

Q-learning/SARSA  for the PD-Word (http://www2.cs.uh.edu/~ceick/ai/2017-World.pptx) was used to conduct 3 experiments using different parameters and policies, Summary and interpretation of the experimental results is available in Report.pdf. 

Developed a path visualization techniques that is capable to shed light on what paths the learning system actually has learnt from obtained Q-Tables.
More details of the exact problem statement is available in Problem Statement.docx file. 


Readme.txt and Report.pdf has the details of how to run the code and results and observation of the 3 expirements performed.
